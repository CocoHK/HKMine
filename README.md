# Mr. Mine

Mr. Mine was one of my personal projects done in 2013 and 2014.

Minesweeper is one of my best games when I was young, but at that time I didn't find any good minesweeper game which fit my aesthetics. So I made one just for fun :)

This is a typical minesweeper game in iOS7 style, three basic levels and you can customise different levels.

EnjoyÔºÅ
